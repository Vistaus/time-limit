# Timer

A simply beautiful timer app for elementary OS.
Heavily inspired by [Michael Villar's Timer for Mac](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app).

## Building and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:
* glib-2.0
* gtk+-3.0
* meson
* valac

Simply run

```
./install.sh
```

The install script configures the build environment, compiles the app and installs it.
The app is started automatically after successful installation.
